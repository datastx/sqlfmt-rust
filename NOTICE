The following components are derived from the original sqlfmt project:

1. SQL Test Files (tests/data/):
   The SQL test fixture files in the tests/data/ directory (including files in
   the preformatted/, unformatted/, and errors/ subdirectories) are derived from
   the original sqlfmt project and remain under the copyright of Ted Conbeer.

2. Formatting Logic:
   The core SQL formatting approach, including tokenization patterns and line
   merging strategies, was originally designed by Ted Conbeer in the Python
   sqlfmt project and has been ported to Rust with modifications.

This Rust implementation includes changes to the formatting style and behavior
beyond the original Python sqlfmt project.
